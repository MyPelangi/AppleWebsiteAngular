    <p><small>* Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they
        purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary by
        Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to
        availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple
        Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the
        Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly
        Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option
        available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple
        Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months
        for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for
        the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment
        plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will
        receive and be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the Eligible
        Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select
        it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store
        app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
        support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when
        you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs
        for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of February 1,
        2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an
        ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is
        subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the
        variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as
        your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at
        any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee
        Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses;
        Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for
        each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
        financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths
        and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to ACMI
